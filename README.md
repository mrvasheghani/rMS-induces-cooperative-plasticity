# A-computational-synapse-model-for-TMS-TBS-effects
Python codes in this repository are developed for performing a thesis in MSc in Biophysics at the university of Tehran titled "Modeling of long-term synaptic plasticity induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation on the human brain."
Codes' name start with the figures' name which they produce in an unpublished manuscript.
For running some of codes you will need to install NetPyNE (http://www.netpyne.org/), which is a python package to facilitate the development of biological neuronal networks using the NEURON simulator (https://neuron.yale.edu/neuron).
Befor running codes that use NetPyNE, you will need to compile .mod files in the mechanisms folder and put them in the same folder with codes.
