# rMS-induces-cooperative-plasticity
Python codes in this repository are developed to study cooperative Pre- and post-synapse stimulation effects on plasticity.
For running codes you will need to install NetPyNE (http://www.netpyne.org/), which is a python package to facilitate the development of biological neuronal networks using the NEURON simulator (https://neuron.yale.edu/neuron).
Befor running codes that use NetPyNE, you will need to compile .mod files in the mechanisms folder and put them in the same folder with codes.
The Sim_Data file must be in same folder with codes and complied .mod files.
